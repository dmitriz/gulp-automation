## LiveReload
[**LiveReload**](http://livereload.com/) monitors changes in your files and instantly updates all changes in your browser. It is very useful when you are updating your site and **don't want to keep manually reloading** the page in your browser again and again after every edit.

Surprisingly there seems to be lack of **simple clean working solutions** that are **easy to install, maintain and customize**. 

Many of them are based on installing a **Chrome browser extension**. However, in addition to being **limited** to the Chrome browser, [extensions are potentially **vulnerable**](http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/it-security/chrome-extensions-are-vulnerable-advantage-bad-guys/). Extensions can also be guilty to slow down your browser, by adding unnecessary and slow running scripts blocking your useful content. As extension runs on **every page** in your browser, it doesn't seem to be a good fit for the purpose of LiveReload.

Other solutions are based on manually adding a script tag inside your HTML file. This adds to the **maintenance headache** to remember removing it from your production code, among others.

Both extension and extra tags are completely **unnecessary**!

## Dead simple way to enjoy LiveReload!

- [Download and Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/download/), see [How do I get started with Node.js](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2353818/how-do-i-get-started-with-node-js) for more information.

- [Download this Repository](https://github.com/dmitriz/gulp-automation/archive/master.zip),
unzip it and change to the created subdirectory `gulp-automation-master`.

- **That's it!** Now start your Local Server, LiveReload and your Browser pointing to the right location with **one single command** in your terminal:
```sh
npm start
```

## Is LiveReload all it can do?

**No!** When building your site, you need many other tools like [Error checking (linting)](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8503559/what-is-linting), [Minification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minification_(programming)) and [Concatenation](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/12/fantastic-front-end-performance-part-1-concatenate-compress-cache-a-node-js-holiday-season-part-4/) for shorter load times and better performance. 

This is where the [Gulp.js automating system](http://gulpjs.com/) shines at its best. It has great rapidly growing community proving [open source plugins](http://gulpjs.com/plugins/) for all possible tasks you can imagine. Just <em>google "gulp" with whatever task you want</em> ;)

Use [provided `Gulpfile.js`](https://github.com/dmitriz/gulp-automation/blob/master/Gulpfile.js) to edit and add more tasks or write a new one!

## How is LiveReload working?

The watcher part (`gulp` task "watch") listens for file changes and sends notification to the LiveReload server (running by default at port `35729`). 
The main  `connect` server at port `8080` (`gulp` task "connect") injects the following script into your HTML:
```html
<script src="//localhost:35729/livereload.js?snipver=1"></script>
```
That way your browser listens to the LiveReload server and reacts to change notifications.

## FAQ

- What is the point of this solution?

  - To set you up and running with working LiveReload in *minimal possible time, with minimum steps*.
  - To provide the simple commented configuration file `Gulpfile.js`, where you can see all "magic" happen and how you can adapt it to your needs. For easy learning and playing :-)
  - To show the power of [**Gulp.js**](http://gulpjs.com/) and [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/).

- What about other LiveReload solutions that work great?

This is **not only** about LiveReload! 
Have a look at the simple `Gulpfile.js` and extend it to work hard for
many other tasks to **save your time** in the future.

- Why are the *Node.js packages* are included?

For the same reason that batteries are included when you buy a camera :=)
It is more convenient for folks less used to Node.js to get them up and running quicker.
The packages included are tested. 
Installing all packages locally instead with `npm install` should work too.
